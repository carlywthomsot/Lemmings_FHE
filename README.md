# Lemmings FHE: A Puzzle Game with Encrypted Abilities 🐭🔒

Lemmings FHE is an innovative puzzle game that captivates players with its unique mechanics powered by **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology**. Drawing inspiration from the classic Lemmings game, this version introduces a twist where each lemming possesses encrypted abilities. Players must observe and deduce these abilities in order to guide their lemmings safely through challenging levels.

## Understanding the Challenge 🎯

In many traditional games, the mechanics are transparent and predictable. However, the core challenge in Lemmings FHE lies in the obscured abilities of the lemmings. Players often struggle with fully understanding the mechanics at play, leading to frustration and decreased engagement. The lack of an element of mystery and challenge can diminish the gaming experience, making the game feel stale.

## Leveraging FHE for Encrypted Gameplay 🔑

Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) transforms the traditional gaming experience by allowing the encryption of each lemming's unique ability. This innovative approach is implemented using **Zama's open-source libraries** such as **Concrete**, **TFHE-rs**, and the **zama-fhe SDK**. The ability of players to engage in deduction and strategic planning is greatly enhanced, as they must analyze the encrypted behavior of each lemming to determine its capabilities. This not only preserves the confidentiality of the game's mechanics but also adds an exciting layer of complexity and intrigue.

## Core Features 🌟

- **Encrypted Abilities**: Each lemming has unique skills (e.g., climbing, digging) that are encrypted, challenging players to deduce their powers.
- **Enhanced Observation**: Players need to observe lemmings in action to unravel their secrets, promoting critical thinking and problem-solving.
- **Challenging Puzzles**: Each level presents unique challenges, testing players' adaptability and ingenuity.
- **Retro Pixel Graphics**: Nostalgic art style that evokes classic puzzle games, enhancing the immersive gaming experience.
- **Side-Scrolling Adventure**: Experience a dynamic side-scrolling mechanism that keeps players engaged throughout the puzzle-solving journey.

## Technology Stack ⚙️

- **Zama FHE SDK:** The core technology for implementing encrypted gameplay mechanics.
- **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime for server-side functionality.
- **Hardhat:** Development environment for Ethereum smart contracts.
- **Solidity:** The programming language used for writing smart contracts.

   ```

3. **Launch the Game**:
   ```bash
   node src/index.js
   ```

In the game, players will encounter various levels filled with puzzles that will require observation and deduction skills. For instance, the following code snippet illustrates how a player's deduction process could be implemented:

```javascript
function deduceAbility(lemming) {
    if (lemming.hasAbility('digging')) {
        console.log("This lemming can dig!");
    } else if (lemming.hasAbility('climbing')) {
        console.log("This lemming can climb!");
    } else {
        console.log("This lemming's ability is still unknown!");
    }
}
```
